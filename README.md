# symspellpy
symspellpy is a Python port of [SymSpell](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell) v6.3, which provides much higher speed and lower memory consumption. Unit tests
from the original project are implemented to ensure the accuracy of the port.

Please note that the LookupCompound() method is yet to be implemented and the port
has not been optimized for speed.
